What You Couldn't Do:Real-time Notifications: There might not be a real-time notification system for HR when a manager approves/rejects a candidate.Integrated Email System: The system might not automatically send emails to candidates once approved.Document Security: While documents can be exported, there might not be encryption or security features to protect sensitive data.Advanced Filters: Only basic filtering is mentioned. Advanced filtering by other criteria like "date of application" or "position applied for" might not be present.Audit Trail: There's no mention of tracking who did what and when â€“ for accountability and transparency.Manager's Preview of Offer Letter: While managers can preview, there might not be options to suggest edits directly on the previewed letter.What Could've Been Done:Real-time Notifications: Implement a real-time notification system to reduce waiting time and improve efficiency.Integrated Email System: Instead of HR sending an email manually, the system could automate this process.Document Security: Implement encryption for exported documents, especially when they contain sensitive data.Advanced Filters: Incorporate more filtering options to help both HR and managers quickly find the candidates they're looking for.Audit Trail: Implement a feature that logs all actions taken by HR and managers. This would help in tracking changes and understanding decisions.Collaborative Review: Allow managers to suggest edits or changes directly on the previewed offer letter. This would reduce the number of revisions and speed up the offer generation process.Batch Operations: Allow HR and managers to accept/reject multiple candidates at once (useful for mass hiring).Integration with Calendar: For managers, a feature to schedule interviews or reminders for reviewing candidates could be beneficial.
